# code-antoine

Example of C++ codes written by me.
This repo contains a class "Lidar" which inherits from another one "Component".
The target is to be able to capture data from the sensor. 
The class utils implements a clustering process to gather the various points which were collected by sensors like lidar.
You can observe I performed test and logs are also clean !
